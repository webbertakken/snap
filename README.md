# Snap

Snappy screenshots and whiteboarding (WIP)

_**Note:** This is very much a work in progress._

#### About this project

Both the stability and the performance of _Microsoft Whiteboard_ and _Microsoft Snipping tool_ have left something to wish for. Neither tool works that well with 4K resolutions and especially Snipping Tool has become more and more buggy over the past 2 years.

Since I couldn't quite find what I was looking for I'm trying to build my own.

#### Requirements

- 🦀 Learn Rust
- ⏩ Startup in under half a second
- 🖥️ Cross-platform (at least Windows, Linux, MacOS)
- 📉 Snappy experience with high performance

#### Features

- 🐛 No nonsense screenshots, without buggy media protection
- ✏️ Draw on screenshots or simply on a blank page (whiteboard)
- 🚦 Easily accessible palette that allows single-click colour changing
- 📂 Sync files to Google Drive (optionally other providers)

#### Nice to have

- 🌙 Light and Dark mode
